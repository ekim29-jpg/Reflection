        This reading made me compare the social media platforms with websites. Since most social media platforms are updated in real-time and overloaded with information, people enjoy their immediacy, which satisfies people's desire to know each other faster. However, the amount of information on social media quickly becomes overwhelming. As mentioned in the article, the format and way of self-expression are restricted by a specific format and algorithm, while websites allow more freedom. The interactions that happen on websites can be slow, less visible, and ephemeral. But websites can represent me fully and accurately, without squeezing me into predefined templates. This led me to a question: can we return to a world where there was limited information about each other? The world where letters took days to arrive, and lovers spent hours just wondering about each other? I know we can’t truly go back. But maybe we can design a contemporary version of that distance. Perhaps a website can embody the concept of being unreachable while still allowing self-expression; a space that is far from immediacy, visibility, and constant updates. I want to experiment with this idea by creating a website that represents me in a deliberately slow and delayed way.

    The reading points out that handmade web makes a correlation between web pages and handmade print materials. The printed materials, such as zines, pamphlets, and artist books, are tactile and hands-on, rather than something infinite. They are also often personal and interactive, which is similar to the handmade websites. They weren't made for advertising or efficiency; they prioritized one's self-expression. They are also correlated in a way that they are ephemeral. Books or zines are not permanent, and similarly, websites can break and become outdated. The most important point is that they both require significant labor to create, from the content to the design choices. As the reading mentions about the iPad, people today have lost the concept of creation, as iPads do not show page source, leading consumers to forget how they work and simply continue consuming materials created by others. Therefore, this reading made me realize that intentionality and creativity are lacking online these days, and that handmade websites can perhaps take us back to a world where the 'slowness' and 'smallness' had existed.

<p class="nice"> After reading Taeyoon's Hello World, I was impressed by how the author mentions the computer before it was invented. Back then, a computer wasn't the machine itself; it referred to human computation, a repetitive practice that women were mostly in charge of. This is really interesting because I have never thought about human computation before the invention of the computer, and this broadened my understanding of a computer, since computers were always something complicated for me. As mentioned in the reading, the graphic user interface of the computers is designed to make the users feel familiar and comfortable with the computers, while it is, in fact, widening the gap between users and machines. This also provided me with an interesting point of view since I always believed that the user interface bridges the gap between users and machines. Then the author raises a question: “Are cities computers for humans?” I understand that there is a physical repetition and prediction regarding urbanization, but still, I believe there is more unpredictability in the city we live in. Or perhaps this comes from a reluctance to accept that we live in a city that operates like a computer. </p>
