<p1 class="nice"> This reading made me compare the social media platforms with websites. Since most social media platforms are updated in real-time and overloaded with information, people enjoy their immediacy, which satisfies people's desire to know each other faster. However, the amount of information on social media quickly becomes overwhelming. As mentioned in the article, the format and way of self-expression are restricted by a specific format and algorithm, while websites allow more freedom. The interactions that happen on websites can be slow, less visible, and ephemeral. But websites can represent me fully and accurately, without squeezing me into predefined templates. This led me to a question: can we return to a world where there was limited information about each other? The world where letters took days to arrive, and lovers spent hours just wondering about each other? I know we can’t truly go back. But maybe we can design a contemporary version of that distance. Perhaps a website can embody the concept of being unreachable while still allowing self-expression; a space that is far from immediacy, visibility, and constant updates. I want to experiment with this idea by creating a website that represents me in a deliberately slow and delayed way. </p1>
